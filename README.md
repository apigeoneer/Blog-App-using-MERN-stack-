## Technologies Used

- **MongoDB**: Database for storing user information and blog posts.
- **Express**: Backend framework for building the server and handling API requests.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Multer**: Middleware for handling file uploads.
- **bcryptjs**: Library for hashing passwords.
- **jsonwebtoken**: Library for creating and verifying JSON Web Tokens for authentication.
- **cookie-parser**: Middleware for parsing cookies.
- **date-fns**: Utility library for formatting dates.

## Features

- User registration and login
- JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication
- Create, edit, and delete blog posts
- Upload and display images for blog posts
- View all posts and individual post details
- Display the author's name and post publication time

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- MongoDB (You can use MongoDB Atlas for a cloud-based solution)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apigeoneer/mernstack-blog.git
   cd mernstack-blog
   ```

2. **Install server dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd server
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install client dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd ../client
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add the following variables:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URL=<your-mongodb-connection-string>
   JWT_SECRET=<your-secret-key>
   ```

   Replace `<your-mongodb-connection-string>` with your actual MongoDB connection string and `<your-secret-key>` with a secret key for JWT.

5. **Start the development server:**

   In the `server` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the Express server on `http://localhost:4000`.

6. **Start the React application:**

   In the `client` directory, run:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   This will start the React development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Usage
